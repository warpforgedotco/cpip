"""The decision queue must not change which package is decided next.

``choose_package_to_decide`` reuses each package's sort key between decision
scans and rebuilds only the ones whose inputs were reported to have moved --
the package's range, its conflict and culprit counts, or provider state.
That is a local patch to a vendored package (see
``src/cpip/_vendor/VENDORED.md``).

Its failure mode is quiet and expensive rather than loud.  A key that
outlives an input still sorts, so the resolver simply decides a different
package, and decision order is what determines how much backtracking a
resolution does at all: caching keys with no invalidation whatsoever still
produces a correct answer for every graph here, while taking 47% longer on
the backtracking workload.  Comparing final versions would not see that.

So these tests compare the *decision sequence* against the uncached path,
package by package, which is the only thing that pins the equivalence.
