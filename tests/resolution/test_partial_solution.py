"""Backtracking must restore exactly the state a full replay would produce.

``PartialSolution`` maintains ``_positive_ranges``, ``_negative_ranges``,
``_decided_versions`` and ``_undecided`` incrementally, and ``backtrack``
rebuilds them from the ``cum_*`` snapshot carried by the surviving top entry
of each package's trail.  That is a local patch to a vendored package (see
``src/cpip/_vendor/VENDORED.md``) replacing a rescan of the whole trail, so
these tests pin the equivalence rather than the implementation: they compare
the incremental state against a replay of the surviving assignments after
randomized decide/derive/backtrack sequences.
