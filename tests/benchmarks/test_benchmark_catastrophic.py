"""Real-world-scale reproductions of documented catastrophic resolver cases.

``test_benchmark_resolution.py::test_uv_wrong_package_backtracking_families``
already models these five incidents at a fast-CI-friendly scale (64 releases;
uv issue
https://github.com/astral-sh/uv/issues/8157: wrong-package backtracking
where the resolver locks a recent release of one package, then rejects
hundreds of releases of a related package before finding the one whose
bound actually matches).

These benchmarks model the same five families at the scale that made the
real incidents notable in the first place -- ``catastrophic_wheelhouses``
in conftest.py sizes each one from its packages' live PyPI release counts
(recorded 2026-08-12): boto3 has 2093 releases, botocore 2491; the
"58 minutes of Poetry resolving" and "pip stuck for 5+ minutes" reports
tied to this exact urllib3/boto3/botocore pattern
(https://github.com/aio-libs/aiobotocore/issues/840,
https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/pull/7950) are from this
population, not a toy one.

Separate benchmarks preserve the real transitive Boto3 topology: Boto3
constrains Botocore, whose urllib3 requirement conflicts with the root. This
keeps the historical exact-pin benchmark identities stable.
