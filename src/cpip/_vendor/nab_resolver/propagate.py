"""Unit propagation for the PubGrub resolver.

When an incompatibility has all but one term satisfied, the
remaining term's negation is derived (unit rule).  This module
owns that loop plus the per-term/per-incompatibility evaluators
that classify each term as SATISFIED, CONTRADICTED, or UNDETERMINED.
