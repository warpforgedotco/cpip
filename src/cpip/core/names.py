"""PEP 503 name normalization.

Split out of :mod:`cpip.core.packaging` because this three-line function is
needed on paths that need nothing else from that module -- notably
``cli.fast``, which the entrypoint imports on every command.  Reaching it
through ``packaging`` costs ``platform`` and ``subprocess`` as well, for no
benefit.
